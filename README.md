# guagan api

A quick example of how to unofficially use the guagan api through requests.

This uses [deno](//deno.land)

## Example

In `example.ts` there's an example on how to use the api.

To run the example `deno run --allow-net --allow-read --allow-write .\example.ts`

Afterwards if the connection is successful a file named `out.jpg` should be outputted.
